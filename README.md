# Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM
A deep learning model (stacked LSTM) built with Keras to forecast Apple (AAPL) stock prices based on historical data.

# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning (LSTM)

This project is an end-to-end workflow for time-series forecasting. A stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is built using Keras and TensorFlow to predict the future 'Close' price of Apple (AAPL) stock.

The dataset (`all_stocks_5yr.csv`) containing historical data for S&P 500 companies is included in this repository.
